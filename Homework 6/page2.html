        <h1>The Story of Bob the dog</h1>

        <p>Once upon a time, there was a dog named Bob. Bob had to use the bathroom. Bob was looking for bathrooms, and eventually he saw a stop sign.</p>
        
        <p>Bob peed on the sign. It was much needed relief.</p>
        
        <p>"Now I will run around" Bob said.</p>
        
        <p> Bob ran around and around until he got tired</p>
        
        <p> "I'm tired" says Bob.</p>
        
        <p>Bob went back home and went through his dog door</p>
        
        <p>Bob then curled up on his bed and fell asleep.</p>
