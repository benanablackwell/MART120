        <h1>The Story of Bob the dog</h1>

        <span>Once upon a time, there was a dog named Bob. Bob had to use the bathroom. Bob was looking for bathrooms, and eventually he saw a stop sign.</span>

        <span>Bob peed on the sign. It was much needed relief.</span>

        <span>"Now I will run around" Bob said.</span>

        <span> Bob ran around and around until he got tired</span>

        <span> "I'm tired" says Bob.</span>

        <span>Bob went back home and went through his dog door</span>

        <span>Bob then curled up on his bed and fell asleep.</span>
